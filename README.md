# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Codes-APC 

Here you can find my C++ [^1] codes for the course Algorithms and Parallel Computing (Professor Ardagna, academic year 2023/24) of the Master Degree in Mathematical Engineering.

[^1]: Notice that the last assignment and the last lab are supposed to be executed on MPI.

Thanks to these individual assignments I managed to get a +3 score, but they were really challenging!

Topics:
1. Implement a function for applying the **Adam method**.
2. Create C++ classes to generate an **artificial neural networks**.
3. Complete the implementation of a parallel program that allows to compute the **difference along a specified direction for a given matrix**.

Instead the labs were meant to be faced as a group. So I am grateful to my group members for offering alternative solutions to my version: Lorenzo, Carlotta, Davide.

Topics:
1. Write a program that checks whether a given **Sudoku matrix** is correct.
2. Provide a program that stores information about a **social network**.
3. Provide a program that reads from different files **information about students** and their exams and stores them in a suitable data structure.
4. Write a program that manages the list of players of an **arcade video-game** and their scores.
5. Write a parallel program to perform the **Power Method**.

Finally, I want to thank the Professors for all these challenges and initial codes.
