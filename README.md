# Codes_APC 👨🏻‍💻

Here you can find my C++ codes for the course Algorithms and Parallel Computing (Professor Ardagna, academic year 2023/24) of the Master Degree in Mathematical Engineering.

Thanks to these individual assignments I managed to get a +3 score, but they were really challenging!

Instead the labs were meant to be faced as a group. So I am grateful to my group members for offering alternative solutions to my version: Lorenzo, Carlotta, Davide.
